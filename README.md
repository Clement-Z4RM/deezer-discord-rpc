# Deezer Discord RPC

A Discord RPC for showing the music you're listening to on Deezer (like Spotify integration).

## Features

* Updates every 500ms so the RPC updates almost instantly
* Shows the song title, the song artist(s), the album cover (when the mouse is over the album cover the album title is shown), the song duration
* On the RPC there's a "Listen along" button like on the Spotify integration. This is a link to the song
* An in-app updater
* Can hide the activity if song is not playing
